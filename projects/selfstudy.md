Graduating from school has been a long and difficult transition which has proven much harder than expected. A bit part of that was coursework - I loved my courses at school, especially the graduate level courses in my final couple years.

Nearly a year after graduating I had a realization: there's no reason I can't continue to learn.

So, I began to buy textbooks, and I began to buy a lot of them. They're expensive, but by buying used or ex-library copies, it's been relatively affordable given how passionate I am about furthering my learning. 

I approach each book as its own course, taking notes while reading and doing some of the practice problems. It's been extremely an rewarding process that I am sure I will continue for a long time. 

When I tell people about this, the reaction is often simply, "Why? What is your goal?". For me, it's very simple. Of course there is the pragmatic reason that I can list them here on this website to show to future employers. But, much more than that, I am passionate about the material and want to drink it in.

On this page, I'll put a list of the textbooks I've gone through so far and also the books I plan to go through. Ideally, I'd like to put a short paragraph of my thoughts of each one as well but I'll save that for the future. By far, the hardest part of this process has simply been finding which book to read next considering my only option has been to shoot random Google searches in the dark. I would absolutely love to provide a more unified list of books for people interested in the same research areas as me to go through.
